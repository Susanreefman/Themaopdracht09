## Week 1

This is a dataset of bird sound recordings, a specific subset gathered from the Xeno Canto collection to form a balanced dataset across 88 species commonly heard in the United Kingdom.

```{r data}
data <- read.csv('train.csv', header = T)
str(head(data))

data %>% select(id, chromogram_0_0, species)

summary(data)

a <- data %>% select(!c(genus, species))


boxplot(log2(a[1:20]))
```
